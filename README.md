# PHSX815_Project2
Respository for PHSX 815 Project 2. There are two folders: Python and PDF. The Python folder contains all of the python code that has been written for project 2 so far. The PDF folder has any compiled pdf file that has been written so far.

## Python
This folder contains the  `Proj2_Gen+Write.py`, `Proj2_Read+Plot_v2.py`, `MySort.py`, and `Random.py` scripts. `Proj2_Gen+Write.py` is supposed to generate random number distributions based on a Poisson distribution. Currently it is based on a rate the user feeds to it. Nuisance variables have not been implemented yet. Insight into how I could do this would be appreciated. `Proj2_Read+Plot_v2.py` reads in three files and creates plots of them. So far it can read in the files and calculates distribution properties. The LLR and power of the test need to be calculated as well as best methods for calculating it would be appreciated. `MySort.py` and `Random.py` are dependancies of the previous two scripts with `MySort.py` sorting results from the random number distributions and `Random.py` is the random number generator class.
